# ATS-workflow
## For Mos_Test 
This is a case of Richard’s flow (case of infiltration at the top, base flow at the bottom)
Basic Input paramers are:
Input
Domain mesh only (1,1,20)
Cycle = 1 year
PK solved = Richards flow
Boundary conditions =  @ top – mass flux, outward mass flux–  -0.004
Initial condition – hydrostatic head = “-19” and density of 1000
Independent variable –porosity = 0.45, permeability = 4.5 e-12
